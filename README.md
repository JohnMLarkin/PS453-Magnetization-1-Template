# PS453-Magnetization-1-Template
Template for part 1 of the magnetization experiment

This repository provides class-based Python solutions for communicating with:

* a BK Precision 9172 power supply (via `bk9172.py`)
* a Siglent SDS 1052DL oscilloscope (via `siglent_oscilloscope.py`)

Some Jupyter notebook templates for exploring communication with those instruments are provided:

* `intro_to_power_supply.ipynb`
* `intro_to_oscilloscope.ipynb`

These must be run on the local computer (in VS Code or via a local Jupyter server), not in a cloud-based service like Colab.
